Big news from Anthropic: **OpenClaw will live on as an open-source project.** The announcement, confirmed on February 15th, puts to rest months of speculation about the agent framework's future.

## Why This Matters

OpenClaw has become the de facto standard for building AI agents. With its MCP integration, multi-provider support, and extensible skill system, it's the backbone of thousands of production deployments.

The commitment to open source means:

- **No vendor lock-in** — you own your agent configs, your data, your stack
- **Community-driven development** — PRs, skills, and integrations from the community
- **Fork-friendly** — build your own flavour without legal worry
- **Transparent roadmap** — development happens in the open on GitHub

## What It Means for VibeClaw

VibeClaw is built on top of OpenClaw. This announcement gives us confidence to keep building. When the foundation is open source, everything built on top has a stable base.

We'll continue shipping tools that make OpenClaw accessible to everyone — starting with the browser-based sandbox, the Forge builder, and the news section you're reading right now.

## The Bigger Picture

The AI agent space is consolidating fast. Proprietary platforms are locking users in with custom formats and closed ecosystems. OpenClaw staying open source is a statement: **the best AI tools should be accessible to everyone.**
